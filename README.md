New-Program

Local Repository for setting up Git hub folder structure.
This repository will need to be updated to github once set up.

Proposed folder structure:

*This structure may change as needed.
*Program branches are fully seperated, will try to write code so multiple os bases can be covered with 1 codebase (i.e. windows and Linux compiled from save source code.)
